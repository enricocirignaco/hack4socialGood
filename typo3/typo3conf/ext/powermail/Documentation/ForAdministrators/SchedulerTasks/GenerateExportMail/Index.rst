Image example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|scheduler_export1|

Console example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can call a scheduler task directly from the console (if the backend user _cli_lowlevel exists) -
see this example (called from webroot):

.. code-block:: text

	typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase task:export --receiver-emails="receiver1@domain.org" --page-uid=140 --period=86400

Note
^^^^

If you need your own HTML-Template for XLS- or CSV-generating, you can define the templateRootPath in
your **root TypoScript**

.. code-block:: text

	module.tx_powermail.view.templateRootPaths.1 = fileadmin/yourPath/Templates/

After that, you can copy the ExportXls.html and/or ExportCsv.html to fileadmin/yourPath/Templates/Module/ExportXls.html
and modify it.
