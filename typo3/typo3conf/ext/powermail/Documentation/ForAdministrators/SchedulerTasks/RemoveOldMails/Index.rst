.. _garbageCollector:

Remove old mails and answers
----------------------------

If you activate this feature in **Extension Manager Settings**,
you can use the scheduler backend module to remove old
entries of mails and answers by a given number of days.

Note: Deleted records are completely removed from the
database! There is no way to reactivate them without a backup.
