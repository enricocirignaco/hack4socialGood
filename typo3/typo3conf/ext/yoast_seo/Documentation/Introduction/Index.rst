What does it do?
================

This extension brings the content analyzer tools from YoastSEO to the interface of TYPO3 CMS. This Content analysis can
generate interesting metrics about a text and give you an assessment which can be used to improve the text. Besides that
you can set a focus keyword for every page. The content analyzer takes this into account and lets you know if your copy
uses it properly.

Every page includes a snippet preview which shows you how that page will show up in the search results. The title of the
page and description displayed along can easily be modified in the editor.

Not only text on your website matters, Facebook and Twitter are showing bits of your content. Using this plugin you can
easily set texts and images for bot OG (Facebook) and Twitter to reach that particular audience.
