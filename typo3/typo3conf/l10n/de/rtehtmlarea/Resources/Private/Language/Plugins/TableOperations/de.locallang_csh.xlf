				<source>Clicking the "Toggle borders" button makes the boundaries of all tables in the editing area visible or, if they are currently visible, the button being highlighted as active, hides these boundaries.
This applies only when editing content and has no effect when the element is rendered in the frontend.
This button may be configured so that it is activated when the element is opened for editing.</source>
