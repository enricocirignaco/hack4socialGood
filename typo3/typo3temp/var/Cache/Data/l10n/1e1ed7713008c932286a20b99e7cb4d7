This is a description of the various types:

<strong>Header</strong>
This type allows you to insert a standard Content Element header and nothing more.
Almost all the other types described below also include the Header and its options. The Header type provides a way to insert a header without any other content.

<strong>Text</strong>
The Text type allows you to insert regular page content. It is generally used for text only content.

<strong>Text & Images</strong>
This is the same as the Text type (regular page content) but with the option of attaching images.

<strong>Image</strong>
The Image type allows you to insert image only page content.

<strong>Bullet List</strong>
Lets you create a bullet list. Each line in the text field will appear as a single bullet.

<strong>Table</strong>
Lets you create <em>simple</em> tables. Each line represents a row in the table and vertical bars ('|') separate each column. A popup wizard is also available.

<strong>File Links</strong>
Allows you to present a list of files for download. Thumbnails can be attached to the list and you can also display the file size.

<strong>Form</strong>
Lets you create mail forms using a special syntax or a popup wizard.

<strong>Search</strong>
This inserts a search box and also shows the search results when a search is performed on the page.

<strong>Login</strong>
Displays a login box for website users. This is only useful if you have already created website users and usergroups.

<strong>Menu/Sitemap</strong>
Offers a selection of menus and a sitemap you can insert on a page.

<strong>Insert records</strong>
This acts as placeholder for other records. With this Content Element, you can resuse multiple content elements from other pages.

<strong>Insert plugin</strong>
This will allows you to insert news, forums, guestbooks, lists of addresses, and other functionality. Plugins are typically provided by TYPO3 extensions. The available fields and required configuration depend on the extension.

<strong>Divider</strong>
This inserts a simple horizontal rule on a page.

<strong>HTML</strong>
This is plain HTML content. Anything added in the HTML Code of this Content Element will be displayed directly on the page without any preprocessing.";s:6:"target";s:2396:"The 'Type' of content you select determines which options are available in the editing form so be sure to save the record before making other changes.
